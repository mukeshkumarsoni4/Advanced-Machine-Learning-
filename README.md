Welcome to my Data Science Projects Repository! This repository contains a collection of my data science projects, showcasing my skills and expertise in the field. Each project demonstrates different aspects of data analysis, machine learning, and visualization.

Projects
# [Project - 1 Finance Fraud Transactions ](https://github.com/mukeshkumarsoni4/Advanced-Machine-Learning-.git)
1. Description: The dataset contains two-day transactions by European cardholders during September 2013.The dataset contains 284,807 transactions out of which 492 were fraud cases
Due to the privacy reasons, the dataset has been anonymized. The feature names have also been changed (V1, V2, V3, etc.). Hence, you will not gain much insights from visualization
2. Technologies Used:  The notebooks uses LogisticsRegression,Linear Discriminant Analysis,Gaussian Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine Model, Confusion Matrix
3. Results: Model	Score, 4	Random Forest	99.96, 1	Linear Discriminant Analysis	99.93, 3	Decision Tree	99.92, 0	Logistic Regression	99.91, 5	Support Vector Machines	99.83, 6	K - Nearest Neighbors	99.83
2	Naive Bayes	99.28
   
# [Project - 2 Healthcare Predictions of Diabets ](https://github.com/mukeshkumarsoni4/Advanced-Machine-Learning-.git)
1. Description: To predict whether a patient has diabetes based on certain medical predictor variables. Data Retrieval :-
    The dataset includes several predictors (pregnancies such as BMI, insulin level, age, and so on) and one target variable
3. Technologies Used:  The notebooks uses Exploratory Data Analysis and KNeighborsClassifier.
4. Results: The Results : Max trainig score 100.0 % and k = [1, 15], Max testing score 76.5625 % and k = [11, 25], KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=11) accuracy=0.765625
   
# [Project - 3 Marketing ](https://github.com/mukeshkumarsoni4/Advanced-Machine-Learning-.git)
1. Description: Infer relationship between sales and three media budgets: TV, Radio, and Newspaper. The dataset contains sales data from 200 markets
   By the end of the project, the learners will be able to learn the approaches required for Multiple Linear Regression
2. Technologies Used:  The notebooks uses Data Analysis,Data Normalization,Linear Regression (Scaled Data),Single Linear Regression,Multiple Linear Regression.
3. Results: Linear Regression (Scaled Data) : 1. Intercept : 14.0225, 2. Coef : array([0.04753664])
   
# [Project - 4 Finance Credit Card Default ](https://github.com/mukeshkumarsoni4/Advanced-Machine-Learning-.git)
1. Description: We have information about credit card balance and annual income for 10,000 individuals. Based on the data, we need to predict whether the individual will default on a monthly credit card balance.
2. Technologies Used:  The notebooks uses TensorFlow Estimator and LinearRegressor.
3. Results: The logistic regression gave ['predictions': array([51347.23], dtype=float32)].

# [Project - 5 HR Player Salary ](https://github.com/mukeshkumarsoni4/Advanced-Machine-Learning-.git)
1. Description: Predict the Baseball major league player salary based on career and previous season statistics, We have career statistics and previous year statistics for 322 players
By the end of the project, the learners will be able to learn the approaches required for Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, and PCA
2. Technologies Used:  The notebooks uses Principal Component Analysis, Ridge Regression, Cross Validation - RidgeCV, Optimal Ridge Regression
3. Results: Mean Squared Error:  117301.05503374818, Lasso Regression : 27.50328326187841, Minimum MSE : 129143.40500200151
